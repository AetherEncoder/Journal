              &emsp;The event titled Big Data and IoT: Paving the Way to Our Future was a Balik Talent Lecture held on August 20, 2024, at 8:30 AM in the ATA Hall. This lecture was organized for the College of Computer Studies students, with the guest speaker being Mr. Abraham Johannes T. Tourbier, BSIT 2020, now a distinguished Senior Big Data Engineer at SmartPlement Singapore. The topic of the lecture was Big Data and IoT, which stands for the Internet of Things.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;During the lecture, I learned that IoT refers to a network of interconnected devices that collect and share data. This data accumulates to such a vast scale that it is termed Big Data, which requires analysis to unlock its potential. Mr. Tourbier shared how his company leverages IoT and Big Data to implement practical solutions, such as controlling lights in large rooms to conserve energy and measuring plant moisture levels to optimize watering and fertilization. These real-world applications showcased how powerful Big Data and IoT can be in solving everyday challenges, making the session highly insightful.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This lecture expanded my understanding of how information can be utilized not just as a source of knowledge but as a tool to solve complex problems. It emphasized the importance of developing tools capable of analyzing Big Data, as it exceeds human capacity for manual processing. For the first time, I fully understood why the field is called Information Technology—because information has become the most valuable resource of our era. This realization has reshaped my perspective, highlighting the immense potential hidden in data waiting to be harnessed.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have developed a deeper appreciation for data as an invaluable resource with infinite potential. It has inspired me to explore its possibilities and to value the role of technology in transforming raw information into meaningful solutions.

              &emsp;CodeQuest took place on August 22, 2024, at 1:00 PM in Room CC05. The event was a programming competition with participants forming teams of 1 to 3 members. I participated as part of a team named "Jay and His Servants." Our task was to solve three programming problems of varying difficulty—easy, medium, and hard—using the C language. The experience was intense and challenging, providing a chance to test our programming skills under time constraints.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;When I first read the "easy" problem, I felt optimistic about solving it. However, I stumbled on string comparison, mistakenly thinking the == operator would work. Normally, this would have been the end of our journey. Fortunately, the organizers noticed that all teams were struggling and allowed us to use the internet for reference (AI assistance was still prohibited). This rule change enabled us to make significant progress on the medium problem, although we skipped the easy and hard ones due to time limitations. When the competition ended, we assumed defeat, but surprisingly, we were declared the winners. Despite the victory, I didn't feel any pride; our performance fell far short of excellence.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience reshaped my understanding of the difference between being the best and being truly good. Winning didn't feel like an achievement but rather an acknowledgment that none of the participants—including my team—were prepared enough. It was a humbling reminder of how vast the field of programming is and how much we still need to learn. This competition wasn't a triumph but an eye-opener, pushing me to reflect on my current skill level and the effort required to improve. I now see this event as a stepping stone toward becoming a programmer I can truly be proud of.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have adopted a new mindset: being the best is the bare minimum, while striving for constant improvement is the ultimate goal. This experience has ignited a fire within me to work harder, grow as a programmer, and return to future competitions with skills and confidence worthy of celebration.

              &emsp;The Guidance and Counseling Group Dynamics Activity took place on August 19 at 10:00am and lasted for about an hour and 30 minutes. Held at the ATA Hall, the event was specifically designed for first-year students from the College of Computer Studies, including myself. The main goal was to help us feel more comfortable with one another, easing the nervousness and awkwardness that often come with starting college.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;The activity included engaging games such as Evolution Rock-Paper-Scissors, where players "evolved" into different creatures after winning rounds, and a team-based snake game where participants worked together to protect their team's "tail" while trying to capture another's. Through these activities, I realized that despite not knowing each other, it was possible to collaborate and build rapport in a short amount of time. What I liked most was how the games fostered connections and camaraderie, even among strangers. However, as someone introverted, I found the experience a bit challenging since the activities seemed designed with extroverts in mind.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience significantly impacted my worldview, making me understand that being extroverted isn't as daunting as I had imagined. The presence of a large group made it easier for me to feel comfortable, as attention wasn't focused on any one person. I realized that much of my hesitation toward socializing is mental, and overcoming that mindset could greatly enhance my social skills. I can apply this insight in my daily life by being friendlier and more proactive in starting conversations. Participating in similar activities in the future could help me further overcome my nerves and gradually build confidence in public settings.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who values building connections and taking initiative. I aim to start small but consistent steps toward improving my social skills and becoming more comfortable in situations that require me to take the lead. This activity has inspired me to embrace growth and step out of my comfort zone.

              &emsp;The Keyboard Blitz event took place on August 20, 2024, at 2:00 PM and lasted for about an hour. Held in Room CC10, the activity gathered participants and organizers for a competition centered on typing. The objective was simple: to have fun while testing and comparing typing speed and accuracy among competitors. As one of the participants, my role was that of a lead performer, actively competing in the event.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Initially, I assumed the event would be easy for me. I had always considered myself a fast typist, as my family often complimented my speed. However, my confidence faltered when the organizers announced rules that shifted the focus from speed to accuracy—a glaring weakness of mine. As the competition began, my performance was underwhelming. I ranked among the lowest, even trailing behind participants I had underestimated during warm-ups. This humbled me and made me realize I wasn't as proficient as I had believed.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience deeply impacted my self-perception. I once thought my typing speed made me exceptional, but I realized my proficiency stemmed more from repeated practice than innate talent. This realization sparked a broader understanding: my current skills result from passion and persistence. If I became proficient at typing through enjoyment and repetition, the same principle could apply to other skills I might pursue. This insight redefined my approach to growth and improvement. To become great at something, I must first learn to appreciate and enjoy it.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who embraces a growth mindset. I may not be a natural genius, but I recognize the potential to become a prodigy through dedication and passion. I feel empowered by the knowledge that I can excel at anything I choose to invest in, making me more confident and open to exploring new interests.

              &emsp;The University-Wide Orientation took place on September 11, 2024, at 9:00 AM in the Luce Auditorium. The event lasted for approximately four hours and aimed to introduce freshmen students to the essential aspects of university life. Topics included guidance and counseling, university policies, anti-sexual harassment guidelines, safe spaces, library services, medical assistance, and more.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;One key takeaway from the orientation was how much the university prioritizes its students' well-being, especially regarding issues like sexual abuse and assault. A significant portion of the program was devoted to these topics, emphasizing their importance. While some attendees might have found this segment lengthy, I appreciated the university's thoroughness. I also enjoyed the intermission performances, such as the Tula Dula, trumpet playing, and the acapella performance. I enjoyed the program so much that I attended the afternoon session for Batch 2 as well. This activity highlighted my value of balancing impatience with the willingness to endure for long-term benefits.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience profoundly changed my perspective. I am now more aware of the consequences and impacts of violating laws related to sexual harassment and safe spaces. The orientation helped me understand the serious repercussions these actions have on individuals and reinforced how critical it is to address them. I feel grateful for the university's dedication to raising awareness on these matters.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have become more knowledgeable about the effects of sexual harassment and the importance of fostering a culture of respect. I am now committed to upholding these values and contributing to a safer and more inclusive environment.

              &emsp;The TechChika event was organized by DEVCON Philippines and held virtually on October 12, 2024, via Zoom. The session started at 6:00 PM and lasted approximately two hours. As a participant, my role was to listen to the insightful talks and engage in the open forum. The event covered a wide array of tech-related topics, including project management, artificial intelligence (AI), and strategies for thriving in the tech industry.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;During the session, I gained valuable insights. For project management, I learned the importance of balancing time, stakeholders, and budget while maintaining adaptability due to ever-changing requirements. Clear documentation at the project's onset was emphasized to align stakeholders with goals. In the realm of AI, the speakers explained how it simplifies syntax problems and automates processes, offering immense advantages for businesses. However, the discussion also highlighted the risks of over-reliance on tools like language models. AI should serve as an aid, not a crutch, with healthcare and med-tech fields showing promising applications. The overarching lesson was to leverage technology wisely or risk falling behind.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience significantly altered my perspective. It underscored the importance of adaptability in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. To thrive in the next century, one must let go of outdated practices, embrace change, and continuously rebuild skills. At the same time, maintaining integrity and understanding the tools we use are essential. This event inspired me to evolve as a programmer and student, equipping me with a mindset to face challenges with resilience.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone unafraid of transformation. I am willing to dismantle and rebuild my skills and beliefs to achieve greater heights. Starting from zero to reach 100 is no longer daunting—it is a journey I embrace wholeheartedly.

              &emsp;The CCS Founders Week Opening Devotion took place on August 19, 2024, at 7:30 in the morning. It lasted for about an hour and was held at the SU Church. The event was attended by students from the College of Computer Studies. The central message of the devotion was a reminder to "Commit all activities to God, connect to God in prayer, and surrender all the glory and credit to God alone."
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Through this activity, I learned the importance of placing God at the center of everything we do. Initially, I expected the Founders Week celebration to focus primarily on commemorating the establishment of Silliman University. However, the church devotion showed me a deeper aspect: the celebration is not just about historical milestones but also about acknowledging God's role in the university's success and growth. This perspective helped me appreciate the strong faith our ancestors had in God, which continues to guide the institution today. While I did not find anything to dislike about the activity, I particularly enjoyed the breakfast we had afterward.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;As someone who does not consider myself very religious, I was amazed by how deeply faith in God empowers those who believe in Him. This experience opened my eyes to the realization that our strength, talents, and abilities are gifts from God. It emphasized the importance of committing all our efforts to Him and giving Him the glory. This activity was undeniably beneficial to my personal development, as it deepened my understanding and appreciation of God's influence in my life and the world around me.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now even more ready to embrace the Silliman Founders Week celebration by committing all my actions to God and surrendering all glory and credit to Him alone.

              &emsp;The All-University Academic Convocation, held on October 14, 2024, at 10:00 in the morning. The event lasted about an hour and took place at the Luce Auditorium. Unfortunately, I was unable to enter the auditorium due to limited space. Instead, I sat outside and watched the program through a television setup provided for those who couldn't get seats inside. As a participant witnessing the event from the sidelines, I heard the president of the university speak about Silliman University maintaining its autonomous status—a testament to its excellence and dedication.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;This activity taught me more about the Spirit of Silliman and the determination of its leaders to continually meet and exceed educational standards. It inspired me to recognize the importance of self-improvement as a way to contribute to the university's mission of becoming even better. I also learned that God serves as our source of power and inspiration in striving for excellence. What I disliked about the activity was the fact that I had to sit outside instead of experiencing it firsthand inside the auditorium. Despite this limitation, the messages conveyed still resonated deeply with me.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I now feel an even greater sense of pride in my university and its commitment to excellence. I realized how remarkable Silliman University is and how God's guidance has played a vital role in its journey. More importantly, I developed a new principle: being the best is not the end goal; it's just the starting point. This activity reminded me to never stop improving, to aim beyond my current achievements, and to always strive for greatness. This mindset is a direct result of the inspiration I gained from the convocation, making the experience truly beneficial.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now reborn as a person who strives not just to meet the bare minimum but to exceed all expectations. I aim to become someone extraordinary—not just a prodigy but a genius who pushes boundaries and redefines what is possible.

              &emsp;The Midweek Prayer Service, held on October 23, 2024, at 6:00 PM. The service lasted approximately 45 minutes and was held at the SU Church. The participants included a family celebrating the baptism of their child and DOST scholars like myself. My role in the service was as an usher, where I assisted in collecting donations and ensuring the smooth flow of the event.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Through this activity, I learned the responsibilities of an usher, including collecting donations using an offertory basket. Initially, I thought the task would be difficult, especially since it required coordination with the other ushers. However, it turned out to be manageable, perhaps because the church was not overly crowded that evening.One person who left a strong impression on me was Trixter, who shared his testimony of faith during the service. He spoke about perseverance, working harder, and maintaining faith in God despite life's challenges. His words resonated deeply with me and inspired me to keep pushing forward no matter the difficulties I face. The most challenging part of the activity was managing my persistent cough during the service. I was determined not to disrupt the solemnity of the event, and Trixter's speech motivated me to endure the discomfort and focus on the task at hand.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience impacted my worldview by strengthening my willpower. It taught me the importance of perseverance—continuing to move forward despite obstacles or setbacks. The event also inspired me to consider participating in similar activities more often as a way to deepen my relationship with God. The activity was undoubtedly beneficial to my personal growth. It provided me with a fresh perspective on resilience and faith while giving me a greater sense of purpose and determination.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now mentally stronger and more mindful of my health. I've realized the importance of maintaining good health, not only for comfort but also to avoid unnecessary struggles during significant moments like this.

              &emsp;The Galilean Fellowship, held on November 19, 2024, at 5:30 PM. Due to sudden rain, the event, which lasted for over two hours, was moved to the fourth floor of Asuelo Hall. The participants included my classmates from our CHS class, while the instructors were students from the Divinity School. The theme of the event revolved around facing our fears. My role in the activity was as a participant, actively engaging in the discussions and reflections.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Before the activity, I expected it to involve simply reading a Bible scripture and discussing its lessons. However, the experience turned out to be much deeper and more personal. At one point, we were asked to speak in front of the class, share our fears, and explain our understanding of faith. What I appreciated about the activity was the sense of reflection and the camaraderie it fostered, as well as the bread that was served at the end. However, I disliked that the food didn't reach me, leaving me without a chance to eat. Another frustration was that the instructors arrived over an hour late, which affected the flow of the event.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Through this activity, I learned that everyone carries their own fears and interprets faith in unique ways. This realization deepened my understanding of how diverse human experiences are. It taught me to view others as individuals with their own stories and struggles, rather than just as people who happen to be around me. I can apply this learning in my interactions by being more mindful and compassionate, recognizing that others have fears and perspectives different from my own. This activity was extremely beneficial in shaping my understanding of human behavior and empathy.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now more aware that everyone has their own fears and life experiences. I am more compassionate and intentional in being mindful of the people around me.

              &emsp;This activity was the Ten Toes Down Bible Study, which took place on November 13, 2024, at 6:00 PM. It lasted for about two hours and was held at Freedom Park in Dumaguete. The event was open to everyone—students, passersby, or anyone interested could join. The primary objective of the session was to discuss the teachings of the Bible and spread its message. My role in the activity was that of a participant, listening and reflecting on the discussions shared.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;During the Bible study, we discussed a chapter in Psalms that focused on the “Armor of God.” A key part of the discussion was the concept of idleness—how there are moments in our lives when we act without being fully aware, such as mindlessly scrolling through the internet or inattentively going about daily tasks. The speakers emphasized the importance of always being vigilant and mindful of our actions. What I liked most about the activity was the venue. Being outdoors at Freedom Park, surrounded by nature, created a relaxing and open atmosphere that felt inviting and free.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;This activity profoundly impacted me by making me more self-aware. It highlighted how often I have been idle, failing to fully engage in my actions or surroundings. This realization has motivated me to become more mindful of my decisions and to work on correcting my flaws. I plan to apply this knowledge by being more intentional in my daily actions and by fostering habits that make me more productive and thoughtful. This Bible study was a genuinely enjoyable experience, and I am already planning to attend more sessions like it in the future to further my spiritual and personal growth.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have become more aware of myself and my actions. I now take time to consider whether what I am doing is truly beneficial to me and how I can replace negative habits with more productive and meaningful ones.

              &emsp;This activity was the College of Computer Studies University Midweek Convocation. It took place on November 20, 2024, at 6:30 PM and was held at the Silliman University Church. The participants included students from the College of Computer Studies as well as students from other colleges. The central topic of the event focused on the story of David and Goliath. My role in the activity was that of a participant, listening to and reflecting on the messages shared.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;From this activity, I learned that the strength I possess is not my own but comes from God. It is my responsibility to decide how to use this strength—whether for good or evil. The story of David and Goliath demonstrated that David's victory was not merely his own but was a testament to God's power. Similarly, when we face life's challenges or "giants," we must remember that God is always greater. With faith in Him, any obstacle can be overcome. An interesting and unexpected event during the convocation was when someone was dragged out of the church. It was unclear what had happened—whether the person was stuck or struggling with something—but it was surprising and added a moment of uncertainty to the otherwise solemn atmosphere.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;This activity changed my perspective on facing hardships in life. I now see challenges not as battles I face alone but as battles where God is with me. This realization brings comfort and assurance, knowing I have someone powerful supporting me. I can apply this learning by turning to God for guidance and strength whenever I encounter difficulties, ensuring my actions are aligned with His teachings. This convocation was highly beneficial as it gave me a fresh and empowering way to approach life's challenges: with God by my side.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now more confident that I can overcome all the challenges I face in life. With faith in God, I can overcome even the GE 10 online journal project.

              &emsp;The activity I participated in was the PEP Christmas Outreach, which took place on November 27, 2024, at 4:00 PM. It lasted for about an hour and was held at Silliman Church. The participants included PEP students and university janitors. The objective of the session was to initiate the Christmas outreach program. My role in the activity was as a participant, and we were also tasked with distributing gifts to the janitors.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Initially, I expected the event to be held at the Amphitheater in front of the University Church, as originally announced. However, it was instead conducted inside the church and included a lecture delivered by the priest, making it a more solemn church activity. During the lecture, the priest spoke about life, emphasizing that it is a gift from God and that every individual is equal in value and importance. This reminded us to appreciate and recognize the inherent worth of everyone. My favorite part of the activity was distributing gifts to the janitors. Seeing their smiles and joy as they received the gifts was heartwarming and brought out a sense of compassion in me that I rarely display, as my usual demeanor is quite reserved and unemotional.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;This experience didn't change my worldview but rather altered my perspective of myself. I realized how deeply affected I am by the emotions of those around me. Witnessing the janitors' gratitude and happiness filled me with an unexpected sense of joy. It made me reflect on how much more I might discover about myself if I continue to engage in meaningful experiences like this. This activity was eye-opening and has inspired me to participate in more events that allow for personal growth and connection with others.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I discovered parts of myself I didn't know existed. I now feel motivated to explore my inner self further, using this newfound understanding to improve as a person and advance in my journey of self-development.

              &emsp;The activity I attended was Worship Culmination, held on November 27, 2024, at 6:00 PM. It lasted for about two hours and took place in the amphitheater. The participants included anyone interested in attending, regardless of their background. The event’s objective was to conclude the university’s Christian Life Emphasis Month. My role in the activity was simply as a participant, observing and reflecting on the messages shared.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Initially, I expected this activity to resemble a standard church service where the priest delivers a sermon and concludes the session. However, it turned out to be much more profound, as several individuals shared their personal life experiences and testimonies. One story that deeply impacted me was about a man who lost his livelihood to a fire, which tragically occurred on his birthday. Despite this devastating event, he stood strong, continuing to live with faith in God. This story touched my heart, helping me appreciate the blessings in my life and putting my own challenges into perspective. What I enjoyed most about this activity was the sense of warmth and community, symbolized by the shared bread at the end—ham and cheese, to be specific. However, I didn’t enjoy the hot chocolate as much because it was scalding and ended up burning my tongue.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience genuinely changed me. I no longer place as much importance on material possessions as I used to. Instead, I’ve come to value connections with people and the strength to face life’s challenges. This activity reminded me to trust in God’s plan and to have faith that there is a purpose behind every hardship. It emphasized the importance of not only improving oneself for God but also for those we encounter in life.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now better equipped to accept life’s challenges and focus on the positives rather than dwelling on the negatives. This newfound outlook has helped me develop a more optimistic and proactive approach to life.

              &emsp;The event I attended was Freshie Walk 2024, which took place on August 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM it lasted for at least 4 hours. The walk began near the Ravello Field, and we marched towards the amphitheater. The primary objective of this activity was to showcase the freshman students from each college. As a freshman student myself, I participated in the event alongside my peers.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;At first, I expected this activity to be a straightforward march around the campus, concluding without much else. However, I was mistaken. Upon reaching the amphitheater, we were seated for a brief devotion, followed by each college presenting their unique cheers. This added a lively and interactive element to the event, which I found enjoyable. That said, there were several aspects I disliked about the activity. Firstly, it was scheduled at 1:00 PM, when the scorching heat made the experience uncomfortable. Secondly, the amphitheater’s benches left green stains on our clothes, and frustratingly, those stains haven’t come off despite numerous attempts to wash them.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Despite the downsides, the event had its positives. It was uplifting to see how excited students from all colleges were, creating a shared sense of enthusiasm and connection. This made me realize that, despite our chosen paths, we have much in common while remaining unique individuals. I learned that engaging with new people can be both fun and rewarding. I plan to apply this insight by participating in more social events to meet and learn from new, diverse individuals. However, if given the chance to redo this activity, I would come better prepared by bringing mats to sit on and portable fans to combat the heat.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now more eager to join social gatherings and interact with others. This experience has nudged me toward becoming more extroverted and open to building connections with people around me.

              &emsp;The event I attended was Parada Sillimaniana, held on August 26, 2024, at 1:00 PM. It lasted for at least four hours. The main venue of the parade was the Cimafranca Ballfield, which served as the final destination for all college and alumni representatives. The participants included students and alumni from all colleges. My role in the activity was as a parade participant, specifically tasked with holding the banner for the College of Computer Studies.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;The spectators of the parade were seated at the Cimafranca Ballfield, where they watched as each college and alumni group showcased their representation. Our parade started near the COPVA area, and my task was to carry the banner for my college. Initially, it seemed light and manageable, but as the parade progressed, the weight became increasingly burdensome. Thankfully, my teammates showed incredible support by providing water and energy drinks, which helped me maintain my stamina. The parade route took us from the campus, through downtown, onto the national highway, past the Silliman University Medical Center, and finally to the Cimafranca Ballfield. Upon arrival, we performed our college cheer for the audience. The most challenging aspect of the parade was keeping pace with the other banner holders, especially when fatigue set in and distractions became harder to resist. Despite the difficulties, the experience reignited my determination to persevere even when faced with exhaustion.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This activity taught me the significance of teamwork. No matter how strong or determined I might be, I wouldn’t have completed the parade without the support of my peers who provided water and encouragement along the way. It made me appreciate the value of companionship and collaboration. I realized that while going alone might seem faster, moving with others ensures a more sustainable and fulfilling journey.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have developed a newfound interest in working with others. Although I’ve typically preferred working on projects alone for efficiency, this experience has shown me the value of teamwork. It has inspired me to explore collaborative efforts, where the journey becomes more meaningful, even if it takes a little longer.

              &emsp;On September 14, 2024, at 7:00 PM, I attended Kuwerdas Filipinas at the Luce Auditorium. The show featured talented string performers, the audience, and a few ushers managing the venue. The atmosphere was intimate and charged with anticipation. Although I arrived as an observer, I was drawn into the experience as if I, too, were a player imagining a scenario where I’m also performing.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;It was a cold and rainy night. Walking down the road on my path towards Luce Auditorium, I could only imagine how much colder it would be inside. But that night, not once did I tremble. For the entire time I felt their burning passion as they strung their strings. When I finally took a seat inside the auditorium, I was facing right at the center of the stage. Impeccable positioning I would say.  It was still 15 minutes before the program started and I saw each of the performers prepare themselves for the show. Some strung their instruments while some just relaxed. I was expecting the performance to be just then playing their string instruments but God I was wrong. As the program begins, A mysterious man is introduced. He was the conductor. 
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Previously, I didn't really think that conductors were that important in music plays. And that principle of mine held true until the start of the concert tour. As the conductor approaches his mini stage, the players begin to compose themselves and prepare themselves for the start of the presentation. The performance began and they started strumming away. Everything looks like everything is going according to plan. As I observe the performers performing their performance I can see some of them observing the conductor instead of their musical score. That was when it was revealed to me the importance of conductors in musical performances. They were meant as anchors that would ensure that the musicians would play in sync with each other. This show was really an eye-opener for me. 
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;That night, I realized that music is not only just singing or making sounds that sound good. It’s a connection. A connection between different voices and sounds coming together as one with the conductor being the one to bring it all to life.

              &emsp;The event I attended was Alice Reyes' Rama Hari, held on October 5, 2024, at 7:00 PM. It lasted approximately two hours and took place at the Luce Auditorium. To be honest, I found it difficult to understand the storyline. However, despite not fully grasping what was happening, I was captivated by the performers' artistry and drawn into their performance.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;The show was a combination of singing and dancing, with no dialogue at all, which caught me off guard. I initially expected some verbal narrative to guide the story, but instead, everything was conveyed through movement and music. Despite the lack of clarity in the plot, the emotions on stage were palpable. One particular moment that stood out was when characters kissed on stage multiple times—it was surprising yet deeply romantic. Even though I didn’t understand the details of the story, I could feel the emotions they wanted to convey. I felt excitement, intrigue, and amusement throughout the performance. It was a strange but wonderful experience, as the show managed to evoke feelings in me without needing words.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This performance humbled me in a way I hadn’t expected. It made me realize that I may not be as knowledgeable or cultured as I thought. The fact that I couldn’t fully interpret the story highlighted the depth and complexity of this art form. Despite this, I was moved by something beyond logic or understanding. The performers managed to evoke emotions and tell a story without words, and that, to me, was extraordinary. It opened my eyes to the existence of things that defy explanation—things that don’t need to be fully understood to be appreciated. I believe this is the essence of true genius, and I feel fortunate to have witnessed it.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I’ve started to develop a deeper appreciation for creative genius—the ability to transcend logic and evoke something profound. This realization has inspired me to improve myself, so perhaps, one day, I too can reach a level where my work can resonate with others on such an unexplainable and emotional level.

              &emsp;The CCS Acquaintance Party took place on September 28, 2024, starting at 5:00 PM and lasting for around 5 hours. The venue for the event was the Silliman University Elementary School Grounds. The participants included first-year students and staff from the Silliman University College of Computer Studies. The main objective of the event was to foster camaraderie among us freshmen who were essentially strangers to one another. I was part of the food committee for this event.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;As a member of the food committee, my role was to hold up a sign to guide students to their designated food stations. There were two meal options, Set A and Set B, and my sign displayed "Set A." What seemed like a simple task turned out to be much harder than expected. Standing still and holding up the sign for nearly two hours was physically demanding, even torturous at times. There were moments when I felt like giving up, but the kindness of our co-chairperson kept me going. He frequently checked on us and offered to take over so we could rest. Although I declined his offer, his encouragement gave me the strength to push through. While his kindness couldn’t erase all the challenges, it inspired me and made the experience more bearable.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This activity profoundly changed my perspective on struggles. It taught me that even tasks that seem mundane, like holding up a sign, can be exhausting. This realization allowed me to empathize more with people who have jobs that may appear simple but are physically or mentally draining in reality. The experience also inspired me to be more like our co-chairperson—offering help and support, even in situations where it might not seem immediately necessary. The event proved to be a valuable learning experience, contributing to my personal growth and maturity.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have become more compassionate and empathetic. I now have a deeper appreciation for how seemingly simple tasks can require great effort. This newfound understanding has also helped me develop greater patience and respect for the challenges others face in their daily lives.

              &emsp;The Ballet Manila Cinderella show took place on November 9, 2024, at 7:00 PM and lasted for approximately two hours. The venue was the Luce Auditorium, and anyone with a ticket could attend. This ballet performance retold the classic story of Cinderella through dance. My role in this activity was simply that of a spectator, watching and absorbing the experience.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;As the show began, I hoped it would be easier to understand compared to Rama Hari since I already had a general idea of Cinderella's storyline, albeit not in great detail. However, as the performance progressed, there were moments when I found it difficult to follow the story. I kept asking my seatmates for clarification, and to my surprise, they understood everything perfectly—even predicting what would happen next. One unexpected and amusing part of the performance was during the scene where the prince was searching for Cinderella. Instead of merely acting out the fitting of the shoe on stage, the prince interacted with the audience, trying the shoe on random attendees. Of course, none of them were Cinderella, and every failed attempt was followed by a buzzer sound. This interaction added a humorous and engaging element to the show. Through this experience, I realized that there are areas in which I struggle—like understanding cultural performances—while others, like my seatmate Jay, excel.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;The show helped me confront the reality that there are things I’m not good at while others excel in them. This realization initially saddened me, as it made me feel like I was falling behind in certain aspects of life. However, it also sparked a desire within me to rise above mediocrity. I realized that while it’s natural to be good at some things and bad at others, I refuse to settle for this balance. This activity awakened a strong drive within me to improve. I want to excel not only in areas I enjoy but also in those I find challenging, like understanding cultural performances. It fueled my determination to push myself further, to be the best version of myself in all aspects of life.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this show, I am more determined than ever to improve in areas where I am weak, whether it’s understanding the arts, music, or challenging subjects like CHS. My ego and ambition have been reignited, and I am motivated to achieve excellence. I aspire to become a summa cum laude, which means mastering topics I might otherwise shy away from. This show was not just a performance—it was a wake-up call and an inspiration to pursue greatness in all areas of life.

              &emsp;The activity Giving Thanks to the Great Giver took place on November 27, 2024, at 9:00 AM and lasted approximately two hours. The venue for this social gathering was the lobby of the Luce Auditorium. The participants were from diverse backgrounds, as I noticed attendees from America, China, and Indonesia when I glanced at the attendance sheet. My role in this activity was simply that of a participant, taking part in the games and discussions. The event also featured notable figures such as Rev. Jonathan R. Pia and Silliman University President Betty Cernol-McCann along with her husband.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;One of the most interesting parts of this event was learning about American traditions, particularly their Thanksgiving customs. I discovered that turkey wasn’t part of the original Thanksgiving meal—instead, they ate deer meat. I also learned about a unique dish called turducken, which is chicken stuffed inside duck stuffed inside turkey—a concept I found very unusual. Another key insight was that turkey itself isn’t necessary for Thanksgiving to hold meaning; it’s the gratitude that counts. What I enjoyed most about this activity, however, was the free food served at the end, which was a delightful treat.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience reshaped my perspective on Thanksgiving. I came to understand it as more than just a celebration of blessings—it’s a time to reflect on the joy we share with others. It encouraged me to pause and appreciate my happiness and the reasons behind it. Moreover, I realized that cultural differences, such as those between Americans and Filipinos, should not be seen as barriers but as bridges connecting us. There is so much we can learn from one another, and the warm, respectful culture of Dumaguete is a perfect example of this.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp; Because of this activity, I have become more grateful for the positive aspects of my life. I now find it easier to recognize moments of happiness, understand their sources, and choose to be happy rather than allowing emotions to control me. This event encouraged me to embrace gratitude and to find joy in both the blessings I receive and the connections I make with others.

              &emsp;The Testimonial Parade and Review and Annual Presentation of Sponsors was held on November 16, 2024, at the Cimafranca Ballfield. This annual event showcased the cadets of the ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) as they marched and displayed their discipline and coordination. Since I am part of the CWTS (Civic Welfare Training Service), my role was that of a spectator, observing the cadets’ hard work and efforts throughout the semester.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Before the event started, I decided to arrive early at the venue to secure a good seat in the bleachers. This time, I also brought a portable fan to manage the heat, a lesson learned from previous events like the Freshie Walk. As expected, more people from CWTS and LTS (Literacy Training Service) arrived and quickly filled the area. The event began with a sudden command that led the ROTC cadets to immediately form up on the ballfield, demonstrating their discipline. The most impressive part of the activity was witnessing the cadets’ synchronized marching, a testament to the effort and preparation they had put in over the semester. The most challenging part of the event was dealing with the heat and the crowded venue, but my portable fan proved to be a lifesaver. Reflecting on this, I recognized that my adaptability and foresight to prepare in advance improved my experience significantly compared to past activities.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience changed my perspective on preparation. Watching the cadets perform so precisely, knowing the months of effort they dedicated to perfecting their skills, inspired me to value preparation in my own life. My own small efforts—arriving early, bringing a fan, and staying hydrated—paid off during this event. Preparation, I realized, is a skill that enhances not only the outcome but also the journey. Moving forward, I can apply this lesson to various aspects of my life by ensuring that I approach every task or event with adequate planning and readiness. This activity underscored the benefits of preparation, both in achieving excellence and in overcoming challenges.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this event, I have embraced a more proactive approach to preparation in my daily life. Whether for school, personal events, or new experiences, I now understand that being prepared minimizes stress and maximizes success. The value of readiness has become an integral part of my mindset, and I intend to carry this forward in all my endeavors.

              &emsp;The Christmas Carols event took place on November 30, 2024, at the Luce Auditorium at 7:00 pm evening and lasted for 2 hours. The participants in this event included performers and spectators. The objective of the event was to deliver captivating caroling performances to entertain and inspire the audience. My role in this activity was as a spectator, enjoying and appreciating the artistry displayed by the performers.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This event opened my eyes to the many ways caroling songs can be performed. The program began with an acapella performance by a choir, showcasing the beauty of vocal harmony without instrumental accompaniment. This was followed by a rendition with piano and synth, adding a layered and melodic texture to the music. As the event progressed, the performers introduced hand drums and percussive elements, creating a rhythmic atmosphere. Next, they incorporated actions and movements into their performance, which gradually evolved into a lively combination of singing and dancing. My expectations were initially limited to traditional caroling songs, but the program far exceeded them. I particularly loved how each performance built upon the previous one, transitioning from simplicity to a dynamic, full-scale show. It was an engaging experience that demonstrated creativity and innovation in presenting something as timeless as Christmas carols.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Reflecting on what I witnessed, I realized that the gradual progression in the performances could be applied to my everyday life. Instead of rushing into tasks with maximum effort from the start, I could adopt a step-by-step approach, starting small and gradually building momentum. This strategy would allow me to adapt more effectively and perform better as I familiarize myself with each step. This event was an eye-opening experience for me, showing how taking things one step at a time can lead to a greater outcome. It has inspired me to consider participating in similar activities in the future. Perhaps, I might even join caroling groups to explore the art of music and performance myself.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who values the importance of starting small and growing steadily. It has taught me the value of patience and the benefits of building up gradually to achieve bigger goals. This event has helped me improve my perspective on progress, making me more mindful and deliberate in my approach to personal and professional growth.

              &emsp;The Clean Seas for Blue Economy event was held on September 21, 2024, at 5:00 AM near the basketball court by Cheese Stick Country. It lasted for around 2 hours and 30 minutes and involved a beach cleanup initiative with the participation of CWTS cadets. My role in the event was as a participant, helping to collect trash from the beach to contribute to the cleanliness of the area.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Through this activity, I developed a keen eye for spotting even the smallest pieces of litter on the ground. Initially, I anticipated that we would gather a large amount of trash as a group, but I was surprised by the difference in the amount other groups collected compared to ours. Despite our efforts, it felt underwhelming to see how much more others accomplished. One of the challenges during the cleanup was dealing with wet gloves, which made the task more difficult. This experience highlighted my tendency to compare my progress with others, a reflection of my personal value of being overly self-critical in group settings.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This activity reshaped my perspective by emphasizing the power of collective effort. Initially, I felt disheartened by the smaller contribution our group made compared to others. However, when I observed the beach afterward, it was astonishing to see how clean it had become. It made me realize that even small efforts, when combined with those of others, can achieve remarkable results. This understanding extended beyond the activity—it reinforced the idea that small, consistent steps can lead to substantial progress over time. For instance, improving oneself by just 1% daily can result in being 37 times better after one year.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who values the impact of incremental progress and appreciates the cumulative power of small efforts. It has taught me to be more patient with myself and to recognize the significance of consistent improvement for long-term success.

              &emsp;The Painit Paghatag ug Kainit initiative was conducted on September 16, 2024, at 2:30 PM across the entire campus. The event aimed to provide snacks and coffee to our hardworking school personnel during a time of intense rain and wind. This small yet meaningful gesture was intended to uplift spirits and keep morale high despite the challenging weather. As a committee member, my responsibilities included recruiting volunteers for the event and organizing donations for the purchase of the goods.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;One of the key lessons I learned from this activity is how even simple acts of kindness, such as offering snacks and coffee, can significantly uplift people during difficult times. Initially, I doubted the event's success because I wasn’t expecting many donations or volunteers. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming support we received, both in terms of contributions and participants willing to distribute the goods. Despite being unable to join the on-campus distribution due to the severe rain in my area, I felt immense satisfaction in contributing behind the scenes.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience broadened my perspective on the importance of small gestures. It reinforced the idea that even minor acts of kindness can have a profound impact on others, making them feel valued and appreciated. Moving forward, I plan to show more appreciation for others, even through seemingly small actions, as these can leave lasting impressions. If I could redo this activity, my only wish would be to join the volunteers in distributing the goods personally.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who deeply values the power of small gestures. I’ve come to understand how impactful even the simplest actions can be and how they can inspire people to keep going. This event has given me a richer understanding of what it truly means to show appreciation and care for others.

              &emsp;The 10 Para sa Ateneo de Naga initiative was held on October 26, 2024, at 7:00 PM. Organized by The Sillimanian Initiative, the activity sought donations of at least 10 pesos to support Ateneo de Naga University as it recovered from the severe flooding in the area. My role in this initiative was as a participant, contributing a small sum of money to aid in their relief efforts.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;From this activity, I learned about the significant challenges Ateneo de Naga University faced due to the flooding. The disaster affected the campus and much of the city, leaving the city center non-operational. The university has been providing daily meals and shelter to over 150 Ateneo students and more than 200 non-Atenean evacuees in its gym. I also learned how even a small contribution, like 10 pesos, can provide meals, water, and essential supplies for those affected. This initiative emphasized the power of collective action and resonated with my personal value of doing what I can to help others.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience made me realize that even a modest contribution of 50 pesos can make a significant difference when combined with the efforts of others. It also highlighted the importance of not just donating but encouraging others to do the same. By spreading awareness and motivating others to contribute, I can multiply the impact of my efforts. This activity was valuable in showing me the importance of collective action and the ripple effect of inspiring others to help.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who strives not only to take action myself but also to encourage others to contribute and participate in meaningful initiatives. I understand the power of collective effort and how much more can be accomplished when we work together toward a common goal. This experience has inspired me to be proactive in spreading awareness and fostering a spirit of generosity in others.

              &emsp;The Ding Ibato event was held on November 13, 2024, from 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM at the Ravello Field. The primary objective of this event was to host a dodgeball tournament, with all proceeds going to support a local animal shelter. As the head of the logistics committee, I was responsible for overseeing all logistics-related tasks. Alongside my team of committee members, we worked diligently to ensure the event's success, from preparation to execution.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;My role as the head of logistics involved managing the signing of permits, acquiring necessary equipment, and coordinating materials for the event. Initially, I doubted my ability to handle such a demanding role, as it required a great deal of responsibility and attention to detail. However, through teamwork and perseverance, we managed to complete all the tasks on time. This experience was incredibly educational for me, as I learned about the intricate details involved in organizing an event, including the bureaucratic process of securing permits and the importance of efficient communication. Additionally, I discovered new locations around Silliman University and developed my social skills, which proved vital in interacting with various stakeholders. The most challenging aspect was navigating the complexities of permit approvals, which required visiting multiple buildings and obtaining signatures from various personnel. Despite these difficulties, the most rewarding moment was seeing the event come to life as the dodgeball game commenced. Watching the participants enjoy the activity made all the hard work worthwhile.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience significantly altered my perspective on event organization. I now understand the immense effort and dedication required to make even a seemingly simple event successful. It has given me a newfound respect for event organizers and their commitment to ensuring everything runs smoothly. Moving forward, I plan to apply this learning by taking more initiative in similar activities and volunteering my skills to assist in organizing events. If I could redo this activity, I would prioritize communicating tasks to my committee members earlier to provide them with ample time to complete their responsibilities effectively.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who deeply appreciates the hard work and dedication that go into organizing events. I have gained insight into the challenges and hurdles faced by organizers, which has inspired me to contribute more actively to similar initiatives. This event has transformed me into someone who not only values the success of an event but also aspires to play a role in making it possible.

              &emsp;The Christmas Carolling for Orphans event took place on December 7, 2024, at 6:30 in the evening and lasted for 2 hours and 30 minutes. We began our caroling at Café Racer. The primary objective of this initiative was to raise funds for children in orphanages, enabling us to buy gifts and help them celebrate Christmas joyfully. For this initiative, I served as a lead performer, taking part in the singing alongside seven other participants. Together, we aimed to bring smiles to people’s faces while gathering contributions for a worthy cause.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Initially, I felt unsure about participating, mainly because I didn’t consider myself good at singing. However, our leader’s encouragement helped me overcome my doubts, and I reminded myself of the purpose behind the event: singing for the children. When we performed for the first time, it wasn’t as bad as I feared. In fact, it felt fulfilling to sing for a cause, and as the night went on, caroling became surprisingly enjoyable. I had fun throughout the event, and by the end of our session, we had raised an impressive ₱8,000. I felt incredibly proud of what we accomplished that night.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience transformed the way I view myself. I realized that many of the fears I hold about performing are unfounded, as things tend to go smoothly once I begin. This activity highlighted an essential aspect of my personality: while I may feel nervous initially, I can persevere and succeed when the moment calls for it. If I could learn to trust in my abilities, I could save myself from unnecessary worry and focus on the task at hand. This activity was profoundly beneficial in teaching me a lesson I should have embraced much earlier. If I were to do this again, I’d love to invite more people to join us in spreading joy through caroling.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I’ve grown into a more confident individual. I now understand that self-doubt and worry are often baseless and counterproductive. I’ve become someone who not only recognizes my capabilities but also believes in them. This event has helped me see the power of stepping outside my comfort zone and trusting in myself to achieve great things.

              &emsp;The Silliman Alumni Golf Tournament was held on August 24, 2024, at 1 PM at the Negros International Golf and Country Club. My role during this event was that of a spectator, as I accompanied a friend who was participating in the tournament. While I did not directly participate in the game, I had the chance to observe and assist her throughout the activity.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;At first, I wasn’t very enthusiastic about golf. It seemed too slow-paced and uneventful for my taste. Watching players hit their golf balls and then traveling long distances to continue the game didn’t seem appealing to me. Upon arriving at the venue, I noticed that there weren’t many people, likely because participants could play within a flexible time frame. To my surprise, my friend asked me to drive the golf cart to assist her during the game. This unexpected responsibility turned out to be an enjoyable experience. Driving the golf cart was straightforward, and I found myself having fun despite my initial disinterest in the sport. The simplicity and unexpected joy of being part of the process changed my perspective.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Reflecting on this experience, I realized that enjoyment can be found in the most unlikely places. Watching others find passion in an activity that I initially found dull opened my eyes to the beauty of differing perspectives. Even though I still don’t fully appreciate golf, driving the golf cart was an enjoyable aspect of the day. This taught me to look for the good in situations that I might otherwise dismiss as boring or irrelevant. I can apply this perspective in life by trying to find moments of happiness and excitement even in mundane or challenging circumstances. This activity was beneficial in helping me adopt a more positive outlook on life and finding joy in unexpected ways.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I’ve learned to focus on the positive and appreciate the good in every experience, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. It has helped me cultivate a more optimistic mindset, allowing me to find value and joy even in situations I might initially view as uninteresting. This new perspective is something I hope to carry forward into other areas of my life.

              &emsp;The CCS Esports Leaderboards Semi-Finals took place on August 22, 2024, at 2 PM. I attended the Mobile Legends tournament held at the ATA Hall, where skilled players competed to advance to the finals. My role was that of a spectator, as I was there solely to watch and support the participants.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;When I arrived, I noticed there weren’t many spectators present, which was surprising because I had expected more people to show up. I assumed that other students might have been busy that day. The matches proceeded as expected, but what stood out the most was the unexpected approach taken by the hosts. Rather than adhering to a formal and structured commentary style, they were casual and humorous. For me, this informality enhanced the experience, making the tournament feel more relaxed and enjoyable. It felt like listening to friends narrate a game rather than attending a formal competition.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This activity helped me realize the value of informality in certain situations. While professionalism is important, there are moments when being relaxed and lighthearted can create a more welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere. The hosts’ casual tone made the event less intimidating and more relatable, teaching me that a laid-back approach can sometimes be just as effective, if not more so, than being overly serious. I can apply this lesson by embracing a more flexible and easygoing attitude in social and stressful situations, which could help create a positive environment for myself and those around me.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I’ve learned to balance seriousness with humor and lightheartedness. I aim to cultivate a calm and relaxed demeanor, especially during challenging times, and to bring a sense of comfort to those around me. This experience has inspired me to be someone who can face stress with laughter and resilience, making life’s challenges a bit easier to navigate.

              &emsp;Pasiklaban 2024 took place on October 21, 2024, at 2 PM. I attended the frisbee match held at the Ravello Field, part of the week-long event organized by senior high school students. As a college freshman, I was there simply as a spectator, watching the excitement unfold among the younger batch of students.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Observing the senior high school students brought back memories of my own time as a participant in Pasiklaban. I remembered the carefree days of senior high school when I wasn’t as burdened by responsibilities or stress. Back then, I had more free time to do what I wanted and felt a sense of safety from the challenges of college life. Reflecting on those days, I realized how much I took that time for granted. Instead of making the most of it, I wasted countless hours scrolling through social media, idling away moments I now wish I had used more meaningfully.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;However, the past is gone, and I can’t go back to change it. This realization hit me hard but also brought clarity: I can still take control of my present and work toward a better future. I owe it to my future self to use my time wisely and create meaningful experiences. Watching the senior high students enjoy themselves made me happy but also reflective. Perhaps this is a sign that I’m growing older—old enough to no longer be the center of attention, but also old enough to appreciate the fleeting beauty of youth and the importance of cherishing every moment.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I’ve come to terms with the regrets of my past while finding renewed motivation for the present. I’ve resolved to live with purpose and make better use of my time so that my future self will be proud of my efforts today. This experience has been a bittersweet reminder of life’s fleeting nature but also a call to action to live intentionally moving forward.

              &emsp;The Basketball Sibulan Inter-purok Tournament took place on November 1, 2024, at 6 PM. The event was held at the Sibulan Municipal Oval, with players being men aged 18 and below. This particular match was part of a larger tournament. As for me, I attended the event as a spectator, observing and enjoying the competition.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Given that it was November 1—a day traditionally spent visiting cemeteries to honor departed loved ones—I initially found it surprising that a tournament was scheduled. I assumed people would focus entirely on somber reflections. However, I appreciated how the event was held near a cemetery, as it seemed to provide a balance. After paying respects to their loved ones, attendees could relax and enjoy the game. This juxtaposition of mourning and celebration struck a chord with me, reflecting a part of myself that seeks to find positivity even in sad situations.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience shifted my perspective on how we handle emotions during significant days of remembrance. I learned that sorrow doesn’t have to dominate the day and that it’s possible to create spaces for joy amidst sadness. I realized the value of blending solemnity with light-hearted moments, allowing both emotions to coexist. Moving forward, I hope to cultivate calm and uplifting atmospheres during serious occasions. I also plan to participate in similar activities in the future, as they remind me to embrace happiness even during reflective times.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have become someone who actively tries to uplift the environment, no matter the mood. It taught me that life is a balance of emotions, and it’s possible to find light in even the darkest moments. This realization has helped me grow into a more positive and hopeful person.

              &emsp;The College of Education Sportsfest took place on November 6, 2024, at 8:00 AM in the gymnasium and lasted until the afternoon. The event featured students from the College of Education competing in various sports. As I’m not part of that college, my role in this activity was simply as a spectator.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Initially, I didn’t plan on attending this event, as I didn’t even know it was happening. My original purpose for going to school that day was to work at a booth set up by the DOST Scholars’ Association. However, I had mixed up the schedule and realized it wasn’t my shift. While wandering around, I stumbled upon the sportsfest and decided to watch. Seeing the students play and enjoy themselves made me feel a bit envious. It got me thinking—why doesn’t the College of Computer Studies (CCS) have a sportsfest of its own? Our faculty is very attentive to our needs and experiences, so I started to ponder why they might have decided against organizing one.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;After some reflection, I realized that adding a sportsfest to our already packed calendar might overwhelm us. While a sportsfest sounds fun, it might not be as beneficial given the numerous other activities we’re already balancing. This realization taught me an important lesson: sometimes, what seems good on the surface might not actually be good in practice. It highlighted the importance of pacing events and activities to ensure we don’t lose their significance or joy. I can apply this understanding by avoiding the urge to cram too many good things into a short period. Spacing them out can make each moment more meaningful. This activity was beneficial as it helped me appreciate the importance of patience and balance in life.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have become someone who values moderation and thoughtful pacing. I now understand that spacing out life’s joys and opportunities allows each experience to feel special and prevents unnecessary stress. This realization has made me less impatient and more content with the rhythm of life.

              &emsp;The 5th Sunshine Cup Football Festival took place on November 10, 2024, starting at 6:30 AM. The venue was the Ang Tay Football Field, located within the Ang Tay Golf Course. The players were various football clubs from across Negros Oriental. This event showcased different categories, including U18, U16, U14, U6, U8, U10, and U18 girls.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;While watching the event, I was struck by how talented these young players were. Looking at the categories, many of them were younger than me, yet their skills far surpassed what I could ever manage. I didn’t even think I could compete with the U6 players. Initially, I thought the event might be humorous—just children playing football—but I was completely wrong. These young athletes were fierce competitors, focused solely on scoring goals and winning. Their determination and drive awakened something in me, and I found myself passionately cheering them on. The event was so engaging that I even bought a soccer ball afterward to try it out myself. Every aspect of the event was enjoyable; there was nothing I disliked about it.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience changed my perspective, revealing a side of me I hadn’t discovered before—a genuine interest in sports. Until now, I never saw myself as someone physically inclined, but this event inspired me to reconsider. I realized that sports could be a great way to explore new aspects of myself. The activity was beneficial in sparking this interest, encouraging me to be more active and open to trying new things. I can apply this newfound passion to my personal life by engaging in sports activities and discovering how far I can grow in this area.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now highly motivated to try out sports and participate in physical activities. I am even considering joining fun runs to evaluate my fitness and explore my potential in sports further. This event has not only awakened a new interest but also provided a sense of excitement for exploring a previously untapped part of my life.

              &emsp;The Dumaguete Triathlon 2024 took place on November 10, beginning at 5:00 AM at Pantawan, Rizal Boulevard. The participants of this event were athletes who competed in the triathlon, combining swimming, cycling, and running. As for me, I was merely a spectator, watching the race unfold. The objective of this event was to enjoy the spirit of competition and camaraderie while pushing one’s physical limits.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;When I arrived, I was struck by the sheer number of athletes. I hadn’t expected such a large turnout. What impressed me even more was how prepared and professional they all looked, from their equipment to their well-trained physiques. While I initially assumed that most of them were amateurs, their dedication to this event told a different story. They had clearly invested time and effort into preparing for this triathlon. Observing them, I realized how much preparation goes into events like this—not just physically but mentally. What I didn’t like, however, was how quickly they disappeared from view once the race started. Within seconds, they were off, and it became impossible to track their progress, which I should have anticipated given the nature of the event.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Despite feeling overwhelmed by their determination and effort, I began to think about the journey each athlete must have taken to get to this point. None of them became this skilled overnight. They likely started as beginners, unsure of themselves and intimidated by others’ abilities. Over time, they kept improving through persistence and effort. This realization was inspiring. It reminded me that greatness doesn’t come immediately—it starts with a decision to begin and the courage to keep going. This activity was beneficial in helping me understand that the path to success starts with taking that first step.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have come to value the importance of initiative. Everything begins somewhere, and that starting point is often a simple decision to try. This event encouraged me to start pursuing the things I want to achieve without overthinking the end goal. By focusing on taking the first step and putting in consistent effort, I can make progress in any area I choose to explore.

              &emsp;Run for a Paw took place on November 16, 2024, at 4:00 AM and lasted for approximately three hours. The event was held at Pantawan, Rizal Boulevard, and participants included runners and their pets, as the run welcomed furry companions. The objective was to enjoy a fun run while raising funds for an animal shelter. My role in this event was as a lead performer, meaning I was set to run a 3-kilometer course. Although a 5-kilometer option was available, I opted for the shorter route since it was my first-ever fun run.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;As my first fun run, I was nervous and unsure of what to expect. I followed others until someone guided me to the starting point. When the race began, I felt confident—until I hit the 100-meter mark and my legs began to burn. I slowed to a walk, and to my disbelief, a dog in a wheelchair overtook me. It was humbling and frustrating, but I pressed on. As the race neared its end, I pushed myself to run despite the pain. Crossing the finish line, I was congratulated for completing the 5-kilometer run, which left me stunned—I was supposed to run 3 kilometers! Apparently, there had been a mix-up with my name tag. Despite the unexpected challenge, I was exhilarated and proud of myself. It was the most alive I had felt in a long time.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;The sight of the dog in a wheelchair overtaking me was initially embarrassing and deflating, but it became a moment of profound realization. That dog had faced challenges far greater than mine yet pushed forward with determination. It inspired me to dig deep and give my all, proving to myself that limits are often mental. I completed 5 kilometers that day—something I thought was impossible. This experience awakened a drive in me. I realized that sometimes, the only thing holding us back is our own belief that we can’t do it. This activity sparked a passion for running and the determination to push beyond my perceived limits. If I could redo this activity, I would prepare better by getting a good night’s sleep.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who believes in my own potential and strives to defy limitations. I have learned to think positively, push through discomfort, and aim higher than what seems logical. This run has made me realize the importance of persistence and self-belief, and it has ignited a desire to challenge myself further. I have become the kind of person who faces challenges head-on and seeks to surpass expectations—both others' and my own. I am the egoist.
