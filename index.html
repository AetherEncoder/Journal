              &emsp;The event titled Big Data and IoT: Paving the Way to Our Future was a Balik Talent Lecture held on August 20, 2024, at 8:30 AM in the ATA Hall. This lecture was organized for the College of Computer Studies students, with the guest speaker being Mr. Abraham Johannes T. Tourbier, BSIT 2020, now a distinguished Senior Big Data Engineer at SmartPlement Singapore. The topic of the lecture was Big Data and IoT, which stands for the Internet of Things.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;During the lecture, I learned that IoT refers to a network of interconnected devices that collect and share data. This data accumulates to such a vast scale that it is termed Big Data, which requires analysis to unlock its potential. Mr. Tourbier shared how his company leverages IoT and Big Data to implement practical solutions, such as controlling lights in large rooms to conserve energy and measuring plant moisture levels to optimize watering and fertilization. These real-world applications showcased how powerful Big Data and IoT can be in solving everyday challenges, making the session highly insightful.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This lecture expanded my understanding of how information can be utilized not just as a source of knowledge but as a tool to solve complex problems. It emphasized the importance of developing tools capable of analyzing Big Data, as it exceeds human capacity for manual processing. For the first time, I fully understood why the field is called Information Technology—because information has become the most valuable resource of our era. This realization has reshaped my perspective, highlighting the immense potential hidden in data waiting to be harnessed.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have developed a deeper appreciation for data as an invaluable resource with infinite potential. It has inspired me to explore its possibilities and to value the role of technology in transforming raw information into meaningful solutions.

              &emsp;CodeQuest took place on August 22, 2024, at 1:00 PM in Room CC05. The event was a programming competition with participants forming teams of 1 to 3 members. I participated as part of a team named "Jay and His Servants." Our task was to solve three programming problems of varying difficulty—easy, medium, and hard—using the C language. The experience was intense and challenging, providing a chance to test our programming skills under time constraints.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;When I first read the "easy" problem, I felt optimistic about solving it. However, I stumbled on string comparison, mistakenly thinking the == operator would work. Normally, this would have been the end of our journey. Fortunately, the organizers noticed that all teams were struggling and allowed us to use the internet for reference (AI assistance was still prohibited). This rule change enabled us to make significant progress on the medium problem, although we skipped the easy and hard ones due to time limitations. When the competition ended, we assumed defeat, but surprisingly, we were declared the winners. Despite the victory, I didn't feel any pride; our performance fell far short of excellence.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience reshaped my understanding of the difference between being the best and being truly good. Winning didn't feel like an achievement but rather an acknowledgment that none of the participants—including my team—were prepared enough. It was a humbling reminder of how vast the field of programming is and how much we still need to learn. This competition wasn't a triumph but an eye-opener, pushing me to reflect on my current skill level and the effort required to improve. I now see this event as a stepping stone toward becoming a programmer I can truly be proud of.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have adopted a new mindset: being the best is the bare minimum, while striving for constant improvement is the ultimate goal. This experience has ignited a fire within me to work harder, grow as a programmer, and return to future competitions with skills and confidence worthy of celebration.

              &emsp;The Guidance and Counseling Group Dynamics Activity took place on August 21 at 2:30 PM and lasted for about an hour and 30 minutes. Held at the ATA Hall, the event was specifically designed for first-year students from the College of Computer Studies, including myself. The main goal was to help us feel more comfortable with one another, easing the nervousness and awkwardness that often come with starting college.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;The activity included engaging games such as Evolution Rock-Paper-Scissors, where players "evolved" into different creatures after winning rounds, and a team-based snake game where participants worked together to protect their team's "tail" while trying to capture another's. Through these activities, I realized that despite not knowing each other, it was possible to collaborate and build rapport in a short amount of time. What I liked most was how the games fostered connections and camaraderie, even among strangers. However, as someone introverted, I found the experience a bit challenging since the activities seemed designed with extroverts in mind.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience significantly impacted my worldview, making me understand that being extroverted isn't as daunting as I had imagined. The presence of a large group made it easier for me to feel comfortable, as attention wasn't focused on any one person. I realized that much of my hesitation toward socializing is mental, and overcoming that mindset could greatly enhance my social skills. I can apply this insight in my daily life by being friendlier and more proactive in starting conversations. Participating in similar activities in the future could help me further overcome my nerves and gradually build confidence in public settings.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who values building connections and taking initiative. I aim to start small but consistent steps toward improving my social skills and becoming more comfortable in situations that require me to take the lead. This activity has inspired me to embrace growth and step out of my comfort zone.

              &emsp;The Keyboard Blitz event took place on August 20, 2024, at 2:00 PM and lasted for about an hour. Held in Room CC10, the activity gathered participants and organizers for a competition centered on typing. The objective was simple: to have fun while testing and comparing typing speed and accuracy among competitors. As one of the participants, my role was that of a lead performer, actively competing in the event.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Initially, I assumed the event would be easy for me. I had always considered myself a fast typist, as my family often complimented my speed. However, my confidence faltered when the organizers announced rules that shifted the focus from speed to accuracy—a glaring weakness of mine. As the competition began, my performance was underwhelming. I ranked among the lowest, even trailing behind participants I had underestimated during warm-ups. This humbled me and made me realize I wasn't as proficient as I had believed.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience deeply impacted my self-perception. I once thought my typing speed made me exceptional, but I realized my proficiency stemmed more from repeated practice than innate talent. This realization sparked a broader understanding: my current skills result from passion and persistence. If I became proficient at typing through enjoyment and repetition, the same principle could apply to other skills I might pursue. This insight redefined my approach to growth and improvement. To become great at something, I must first learn to appreciate and enjoy it.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone who embraces a growth mindset. I may not be a natural genius, but I recognize the potential to become a prodigy through dedication and passion. I feel empowered by the knowledge that I can excel at anything I choose to invest in, making me more confident and open to exploring new interests.

              &emsp;The Freshie Orientation took place on September 18, 2024, at 8:30 AM in the Luce Auditorium. The event lasted for approximately four hours and aimed to introduce freshmen students to the essential aspects of university life. Topics included guidance and counseling, university policies, anti-sexual harassment guidelines, safe spaces, library services, medical assistance, and more.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;One key takeaway from the orientation was how much the university prioritizes its students' well-being, especially regarding issues like sexual abuse and assault. A significant portion of the program was devoted to these topics, emphasizing their importance. While some attendees might have found this segment lengthy, I appreciated the university's thoroughness. I also enjoyed the intermission performances, such as the Tula Dula, trumpet playing, and the acapella performance. I enjoyed the program so much that I attended the afternoon session for Batch 2 as well. This activity highlighted my value of balancing impatience with the willingness to endure for long-term benefits.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience profoundly changed my perspective. I am now more aware of the consequences and impacts of violating laws related to sexual harassment and safe spaces. The orientation helped me understand the serious repercussions these actions have on individuals and reinforced how critical it is to address them. I feel grateful for the university's dedication to raising awareness on these matters.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have become more knowledgeable about the effects of sexual harassment and the importance of fostering a culture of respect. I am now committed to upholding these values and contributing to a safer and more inclusive environment.

              &emsp;The TechChika event was organized by DEVCON Philippines and held virtually on October 12, 2024, via Zoom. The session started at 6:00 PM and lasted approximately two hours. As a participant, my role was to listen to the insightful talks and engage in the open forum. The event covered a wide array of tech-related topics, including project management, artificial intelligence (AI), and strategies for thriving in the tech industry.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;During the session, I gained valuable insights. For project management, I learned the importance of balancing time, stakeholders, and budget while maintaining adaptability due to ever-changing requirements. Clear documentation at the project's onset was emphasized to align stakeholders with goals. In the realm of AI, the speakers explained how it simplifies syntax problems and automates processes, offering immense advantages for businesses. However, the discussion also highlighted the risks of over-reliance on tools like language models. AI should serve as an aid, not a crutch, with healthcare and med-tech fields showing promising applications. The overarching lesson was to leverage technology wisely or risk falling behind.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience significantly altered my perspective. It underscored the importance of adaptability in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. To thrive in the next century, one must let go of outdated practices, embrace change, and continuously rebuild skills. At the same time, maintaining integrity and understanding the tools we use are essential. This event inspired me to evolve as a programmer and student, equipping me with a mindset to face challenges with resilience.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now someone unafraid of transformation. I am willing to dismantle and rebuild my skills and beliefs to achieve greater heights. Starting from zero to reach 100 is no longer daunting—it is a journey I embrace wholeheartedly.

              &emsp;The CCS Founders Week Opening Devotion took place on August 19, 2024, at 7:30 in the morning. It lasted for about an hour and was held at the SU Church. The event was attended by students from the College of Computer Studies. The central message of the devotion was a reminder to "Commit all activities to God, connect to God in prayer, and surrender all the glory and credit to God alone."
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Through this activity, I learned the importance of placing God at the center of everything we do. Initially, I expected the Founders Week celebration to focus primarily on commemorating the establishment of Silliman University. However, the church devotion showed me a deeper aspect: the celebration is not just about historical milestones but also about acknowledging God's role in the university's success and growth. This perspective helped me appreciate the strong faith our ancestors had in God, which continues to guide the institution today. While I did not find anything to dislike about the activity, I particularly enjoyed the breakfast we had afterward.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;As someone who does not consider myself very religious, I was amazed by how deeply faith in God empowers those who believe in Him. This experience opened my eyes to the realization that our strength, talents, and abilities are gifts from God. It emphasized the importance of committing all our efforts to Him and giving Him the glory. This activity was undeniably beneficial to my personal development, as it deepened my understanding and appreciation of God's influence in my life and the world around me.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now even more ready to embrace the Silliman Founders Week celebration by committing all my actions to God and surrendering all glory and credit to Him alone.

              &emsp;The All-University Academic Convocation, held on October 14, 2024, at 10:00 in the morning. The event lasted about an hour and took place at the Luce Auditorium. Unfortunately, I was unable to enter the auditorium due to limited space. Instead, I sat outside and watched the program through a television setup provided for those who couldn't get seats inside. As a participant witnessing the event from the sidelines, I heard the president of the university speak about Silliman University maintaining its autonomous status—a testament to its excellence and dedication.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;This activity taught me more about the Spirit of Silliman and the determination of its leaders to continually meet and exceed educational standards. It inspired me to recognize the importance of self-improvement as a way to contribute to the university's mission of becoming even better. I also learned that God serves as our source of power and inspiration in striving for excellence. What I disliked about the activity was the fact that I had to sit outside instead of experiencing it firsthand inside the auditorium. Despite this limitation, the messages conveyed still resonated deeply with me.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I now feel an even greater sense of pride in my university and its commitment to excellence. I realized how remarkable Silliman University is and how God's guidance has played a vital role in its journey. More importantly, I developed a new principle: being the best is not the end goal; it's just the starting point. This activity reminded me to never stop improving, to aim beyond my current achievements, and to always strive for greatness. This mindset is a direct result of the inspiration I gained from the convocation, making the experience truly beneficial.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now reborn as a person who strives not just to meet the bare minimum but to exceed all expectations. I aim to become someone extraordinary—not just a prodigy but a genius who pushes boundaries and redefines what is possible.

              &emsp;The Midweek Prayer Service, held on October 23, 2024, at 6:00 PM. The service lasted approximately 45 minutes and was held at the SU Church. The participants included a family celebrating the baptism of their child and DOST scholars like myself. My role in the service was as an usher, where I assisted in collecting donations and ensuring the smooth flow of the event.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Through this activity, I learned the responsibilities of an usher, including collecting donations using an offertory basket. Initially, I thought the task would be difficult, especially since it required coordination with the other ushers. However, it turned out to be manageable, perhaps because the church was not overly crowded that evening.One person who left a strong impression on me was Trixter, who shared his testimony of faith during the service. He spoke about perseverance, working harder, and maintaining faith in God despite life's challenges. His words resonated deeply with me and inspired me to keep pushing forward no matter the difficulties I face. The most challenging part of the activity was managing my persistent cough during the service. I was determined not to disrupt the solemnity of the event, and Trixter's speech motivated me to endure the discomfort and focus on the task at hand.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience impacted my worldview by strengthening my willpower. It taught me the importance of perseverance—continuing to move forward despite obstacles or setbacks. The event also inspired me to consider participating in similar activities more often as a way to deepen my relationship with God. The activity was undoubtedly beneficial to my personal growth. It provided me with a fresh perspective on resilience and faith while giving me a greater sense of purpose and determination.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now mentally stronger and more mindful of my health. I've realized the importance of maintaining good health, not only for comfort but also to avoid unnecessary struggles during significant moments like this.

              &emsp;The Galilean Fellowship, held on November 19, 2024, at 5:30 PM. Due to sudden rain, the event, which lasted for over two hours, was moved to the fourth floor of Asuelo Hall. The participants included my classmates from our CHS class, while the instructors were students from the Divinity School. The theme of the event revolved around facing our fears. My role in the activity was as a participant, actively engaging in the discussions and reflections.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Before the activity, I expected it to involve simply reading a Bible scripture and discussing its lessons. However, the experience turned out to be much deeper and more personal. At one point, we were asked to speak in front of the class, share our fears, and explain our understanding of faith. What I appreciated about the activity was the sense of reflection and the camaraderie it fostered, as well as the bread that was served at the end. However, I disliked that the food didn't reach me, leaving me without a chance to eat. Another frustration was that the instructors arrived over an hour late, which affected the flow of the event.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Through this activity, I learned that everyone carries their own fears and interprets faith in unique ways. This realization deepened my understanding of how diverse human experiences are. It taught me to view others as individuals with their own stories and struggles, rather than just as people who happen to be around me. I can apply this learning in my interactions by being more mindful and compassionate, recognizing that others have fears and perspectives different from my own. This activity was extremely beneficial in shaping my understanding of human behavior and empathy.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now more aware that everyone has their own fears and life experiences. I am more compassionate and intentional in being mindful of the people around me.

              &emsp;This activity was the Ten Toes Down Bible Study, which took place on November 13, 2024, at 6:00 PM. It lasted for about two hours and was held at Freedom Park in Dumaguete. The event was open to everyone—students, passersby, or anyone interested could join. The primary objective of the session was to discuss the teachings of the Bible and spread its message. My role in the activity was that of a participant, listening and reflecting on the discussions shared.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;During the Bible study, we discussed a chapter in Psalms that focused on the “Armor of God.” A key part of the discussion was the concept of idleness—how there are moments in our lives when we act without being fully aware, such as mindlessly scrolling through the internet or inattentively going about daily tasks. The speakers emphasized the importance of always being vigilant and mindful of our actions. What I liked most about the activity was the venue. Being outdoors at Freedom Park, surrounded by nature, created a relaxing and open atmosphere that felt inviting and free.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;This activity profoundly impacted me by making me more self-aware. It highlighted how often I have been idle, failing to fully engage in my actions or surroundings. This realization has motivated me to become more mindful of my decisions and to work on correcting my flaws. I plan to apply this knowledge by being more intentional in my daily actions and by fostering habits that make me more productive and thoughtful. This Bible study was a genuinely enjoyable experience, and I am already planning to attend more sessions like it in the future to further my spiritual and personal growth.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I have become more aware of myself and my actions. I now take time to consider whether what I am doing is truly beneficial to me and how I can replace negative habits with more productive and meaningful ones.

              &emsp;This activity was the College of Computer Studies University Midweek Convocation. It took place on November 20, 2024, at 6:30 PM and was held at the Silliman University Church. The participants included students from the College of Computer Studies as well as students from other colleges. The central topic of the event focused on the story of David and Goliath. My role in the activity was that of a participant, listening to and reflecting on the messages shared.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;From this activity, I learned that the strength I possess is not my own but comes from God. It is my responsibility to decide how to use this strength—whether for good or evil. The story of David and Goliath demonstrated that David's victory was not merely his own but was a testament to God's power. Similarly, when we face life's challenges or "giants," we must remember that God is always greater. With faith in Him, any obstacle can be overcome. An interesting and unexpected event during the convocation was when someone was dragged out of the church. It was unclear what had happened—whether the person was stuck or struggling with something—but it was surprising and added a moment of uncertainty to the otherwise solemn atmosphere.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;This activity changed my perspective on facing hardships in life. I now see challenges not as battles I face alone but as battles where God is with me. This realization brings comfort and assurance, knowing I have someone powerful supporting me. I can apply this learning by turning to God for guidance and strength whenever I encounter difficulties, ensuring my actions are aligned with His teachings. This convocation was highly beneficial as it gave me a fresh and empowering way to approach life's challenges: with God by my side.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now more confident that I can overcome all the challenges I face in life. With faith in God, I can overcome even the GE 10 online journal project.

              &emsp;The activity I participated in was the PEP Christmas Outreach, which took place on November 27, 2024, at 4:00 PM. It lasted for about an hour and was held at Silliman Church. The participants included PEP students and university janitors. The objective of the session was to initiate the Christmas outreach program. My role in the activity was as a participant, and we were also tasked with distributing gifts to the janitors.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Initially, I expected the event to be held at the Amphitheater in front of the University Church, as originally announced. However, it was instead conducted inside the church and included a lecture delivered by the priest, making it a more solemn church activity. During the lecture, the priest spoke about life, emphasizing that it is a gift from God and that every individual is equal in value and importance. This reminded us to appreciate and recognize the inherent worth of everyone. My favorite part of the activity was distributing gifts to the janitors. Seeing their smiles and joy as they received the gifts was heartwarming and brought out a sense of compassion in me that I rarely display, as my usual demeanor is quite reserved and unemotional.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;This experience didn't change my worldview but rather altered my perspective of myself. I realized how deeply affected I am by the emotions of those around me. Witnessing the janitors' gratitude and happiness filled me with an unexpected sense of joy. It made me reflect on how much more I might discover about myself if I continue to engage in meaningful experiences like this. This activity was eye-opening and has inspired me to participate in more events that allow for personal growth and connection with others.
              <br /><br />
	            &emsp;Because of this activity, I discovered parts of myself I didn't know existed. I now feel motivated to explore my inner self further, using this newfound understanding to improve as a person and advance in my journey of self-development.

              &emsp;The activity I attended was Worship Culmination, held on November 27, 2024, at 6:00 PM. It lasted for about two hours and took place in the amphitheater. The participants included anyone interested in attending, regardless of their background. The event’s objective was to conclude the university’s Christian Life Emphasis Month. My role in the activity was simply as a participant, observing and reflecting on the messages shared.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Initially, I expected this activity to resemble a standard church service where the priest delivers a sermon and concludes the session. However, it turned out to be much more profound, as several individuals shared their personal life experiences and testimonies. One story that deeply impacted me was about a man who lost his livelihood to a fire, which tragically occurred on his birthday. Despite this devastating event, he stood strong, continuing to live with faith in God. This story touched my heart, helping me appreciate the blessings in my life and putting my own challenges into perspective. What I enjoyed most about this activity was the sense of warmth and community, symbolized by the shared bread at the end—ham and cheese, to be specific. However, I didn’t enjoy the hot chocolate as much because it was scalding and ended up burning my tongue.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;This experience genuinely changed me. I no longer place as much importance on material possessions as I used to. Instead, I’ve come to value connections with people and the strength to face life’s challenges. This activity reminded me to trust in God’s plan and to have faith that there is a purpose behind every hardship. It emphasized the importance of not only improving oneself for God but also for those we encounter in life.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;Because of this activity, I am now better equipped to accept life’s challenges and focus on the positives rather than dwelling on the negatives. This newfound outlook has helped me develop a more optimistic and proactive approach to life.
